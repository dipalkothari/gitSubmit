This project is related to an EV charging system.

The frontend is built with React.js, and the backend is built with .NET Core Web API. 
MongoDB is used as the database for this system. Using this system, we can calculate the energy consumed by a vehicle within a particular duration.
Message passing between the applications is done through an MQTT broker.
